##Writing code without tests? Really? 

Software Testing is a skill that you must fully grasp as a software engineer. It ensures that any code you write to production is more likely to contain less bugs.

This project will be focusing on the following.

Starting from

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- Testing External Services
- Mocking with Mockito
- Test Driven Development
- and much more

This project will take through a real example code using Stripe and Twilio and we will be writing every single piece of code from scratch
